Users should be able to:

    View the plates on the left side of the screen and add them to your cart on the right side.
    When there are no plates within your cart, you should see a message that says, "Your cart is empty."
    When a plate is added to your cart, the Subtotal and Totals will automatically update.
    When products are in your cart, you should be able to increase and decrease the quantity.Â 
        A user should not be able to mark the quantity as a negative number.
        If the quantity goes down to 0, the user will have the option to delete or remove the product from their cart entirely.
    Tax is based on the state of Tennessee sales tax: 0.0975

Getting Started

    To get started, download the zipped files (within Podia). This includes all the project assets you need to get started: HTML, CSS, and images.
    Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
    Open the project's README.md file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
    Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
    Happy coding!
    Once you're finished, share your work using #adventofjs
